A hotel menu typically refers to a document or display that lists the food and beverage options available for guests at a hotel's dining facilities. Here's a breakdown of what you might expect to find on a typical hotel menu:

Categories: Menus are often organized into categories such as appetizers, soups and salads, main courses, desserts, beverages, etc. This helps guests navigate through the options more easily.

Items: Each category will list various items available for order. These could range from traditional local dishes to international cuisine, depending on the hotel's location and theme. There might be vegetarian or vegan options, as well as dishes tailored for special dietary needs.

Descriptions: Each item is usually accompanied by a brief description detailing its ingredients, preparation method, and sometimes its cultural or historical significance. This helps guests understand what they're ordering.

Prices: Prices are typically listed alongside each item, allowing guests to understand the cost of each dish or beverage.

Beverage Selection: In addition to food options, hotel menus often include a selection of beverages such as alcoholic drinks, non-alcoholic drinks, hot beverages like coffee and tea, and sometimes specialty cocktails or mocktails.

Special Menus: Some hotels may offer special menus for events, holidays, or specific occasions. These menus might feature seasonal ingredients or themed dishes.

Room Service: Many hotels offer room service, where guests can order food and beverages to be delivered directly to their rooms. Room service menus are often condensed versions of the main restaurant menu, offering a selection of dishes suitable for in-room dining.# Reestar
